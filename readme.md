## Bookshelf only in CSS and HTML

PS: currently the code is not clean.

This is a fun project I started as killing my time in a flight (without internet and any AI tool). Somehow this stuck with me or I would say I was having a lot of fun while building this. 

All CSS and HTML. No JavaScript.


### One div or multiple?

I started without thinking about shall I made it using one div or not? A few of the items are using single div and a lot with multiple divs.
